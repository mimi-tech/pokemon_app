/*
avoid-global-state: This warning is triggered because you're using
static variables (fetchedPokemon and selectedPokemon) to store global state within the class:
The right thing to do is BLoC to manage these values more efficiently.
This would allow for better separation of concerns and easier state updates throughout your app.
I ignored it because, I understood what is required, Which will warrant me making multiple changes. But when building the project. I will obey the rule


Non-ASCII Symbols: I will need the symbols to come as a image. But I don't think it's available now.
